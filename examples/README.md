### SDS examples

This folder contains various examples of using the SDS streaming dataset library.
Each example is self-contained and runs independently, except for the `iter_multistream.py` example, which would reuse the stream functions from other examples.

Any example should be runnable as:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/<example_name>.py
```
